			developed and published by Epic Games. It is a companion game to <i>Fortnite: Save the World</i>,
			a cooperative survival game with construction elements.</mark> It was initially released in early access on September 26, 2017, for Microsoft
			Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by ports for iOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch the following year.
			Epic dropped the "early access" label for Fortnite Battle Royale on June 29, 2020 alongside the announcement that Save the World's
			early access period had ended. Versions for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are planned for when they launch in late 2020.

		</p>

		<p>

			The concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre: 100 players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to
			defend themselves from other players. Players can fight alone (Solo), with one additional player (Duos), or with a group of up to
			three others (Squads). As the match progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts, giving the players less
			and less room to work with. The last player or team alive wins the match. The main distinction from others in the genre is the game's
			construction elements, letting players build walls, obstacles, and other structures from collected resources to take cover from incoming
			fire or give one a strategic view advantage. <b><i>Battle Royale</i></b> uses a seasonal approach with battle passes to introduce
			new character customization content in the game, as well as limited time events, some of which correspond with changes to the game
			map. Since its initial release, several other game modes have been introduced, including "Battle Lab" and "Party Royale".

		</p>

		<p>

			The idea for <b><i>Battle Royale</b></i> arose following the release of <i>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</i>, a similar battle
			royale game that was highly successful, but was noted for its technical flaws. Originally released as part of the early access version
			of <b><i>Save the World</i></b>, Epic later transitioned the game to a free-to-play model funded by microtransactions. Following
			its rise in popularity, Epic split the development team, with one focusing on <b><i>Battle Royale</i></b> and the other on
			<b><i>Save the World</i></b>.

		</p>

		<p>

			<b><i>Battle Royale</i></b> received positive reviews from critics, who praised its learning curve, gameplay, art style, multiplayer
			and progression system, but noted its similarity to previous games in the genre. The game quickly rose in popularity following its
			release, eventually surpassing <b><i>Battlegrounds</i></b> in overall player count and revenue. Player count had exceeded 350 million
			by May 2020, while by March 2019, the game had generated over 2 billion dollars worldwide. The game has gone on to become a cultural
			phenomenon, with promotion through social media and several celebrities, including Ninja, Marshmello, and Drake, contributing to
			the game's popularity, achieving record-high viewership on streaming platforms in the process.

		<p>

			The main gameplay for <b><i>Fortnite Battle Royale</i></b> follows the standard format for the battle royale genre. The game normally
			is played either with each player on their own, or in a squad of two to four players, with up to 100 players participating each round.
			The round starts with players, weaponless, skydiving from floating buses ("Battle Bus") then deploying a glider onto a region of
			land. The island's fixed layout includes several landmarks and locations (named in an alliterative fashion, such as "Lazy Lake",
			"Pleasant Park", and "Retail Row") that are mostly ghost towns, while a random distribution of weapons, shields, and other combat
			support features can be found by searching buildings and other sites. The goal is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating
			or avoiding other players. When playing in solo modes, players are immediately eliminated when they exhaust their health, while in
			squad modes, downed players can crawl around while bleeding out; they can be eliminated immediately by an opponent or revived by
			a squadmate to help them up. Initially, when the game launched, eliminated players were out of the match, but starting with updates
			in April 2019, squadmates can attempt to revive a downed player at various "Reboot vans" scattered around the map, which are few
			and far between and in the open, making it a risk to respawn a squadmate.<sup>[2]</sup> Over time, the game's safe zone (representing
			the eye of a storm), decreases in size, and players caught outside the zone will take damage. This directs the surviving players
			into tighter spaces, forcing player encounters. Supply drops will spawn in random locations during a match, providing random weapons
			and items. Like in the original <b><i>Fortnite</i></b> game, <b><i>Fortnite Battle Royale</i></b> is primarily played in a third-person
			perspective.

		</p> 
			
		<p>

			<b><i>Fortnite Battle Royale's</i></b> primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system, which originated
			from the original <b><i>Fortnite</i></b> survival game. Nearly all objects in the environment can be destroyed and harvested for
			materials (wood, stone, and metal), which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities, such as walls, ramps,
			floors, and roofs, which can be used to help traverse the map, protect the player from gunfire, or slow down progression of other
			players. Weaker pieces can be destroyed in a few hits, but can be built quickly, while stronger pieces can withstand more punishment,
			but take longer to build.

		<p>

			The game is free-to-play, supported by microtransactions that allow players to buy "Vinderbucks", "V-Bucks" for short, the game's
			internal currency. V-Bucks are also shared with the main Fortnite: Save the World game, which offers players the opportunity to
			earn V-Bucks by completing missions or daily quests.<sup>[3]</sup> V-Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player
			(characters, pickaxes, glider skins, back-wears, and emotes). The game is run in chapters with a number of seasons, each season lasting
			about 10 weeks each. Each season introduces an exclusive set of cosmetic items that can be obtained. These are offered through a
			dual-track battle pass, which features a number of tiers that players climb through by earning experience through completing in-game
			objectives, while acquiring cosmetic rewards or other items in the process. Each player has access to the "free" track of the Battle
			Pass, which offers fewer cosmetics that can be earned by clearing multiple tiers, while players can also purchase the Pass'
			"premium" track with V-Bucks,<sup>[4]</sup> which offers more challenges and grants prizes for every tier the player advances.
			Players can use V-Bucks to purchase tiers as well once they have bought the Battle Pass.<sup>[5]</sup>

		</p>

		<p>

			Since release, Epic Games has added more features, such as new weapon and items and makeshift vehicles such as shopping carts
			and golf carts. Epic is also able to deploy hotfixes to the game to adjust aspects like weapon attributes and distribution, pushing
			these out in minutes if necessary should they or players discover critical issues or glitches, as well as removing older or not
			well received items from the game in a process called "vaulting".<sup>[6][7]</sup> With the release of the standalone
			<b><i>Fortnite Creative</i></b> gameplay mode in December 2018, an area of the <b><i>Fortnite Battle Royale</i></b> map called
			"The Block" featured a rotating selection of user-made creations developed in Creative mode and approved by Epic.<sup>[8]</sup>
			A "Battle Lab" mode was added in December 2019 for players to create their own custom battle royale games.<sup>[9]</sup> In April
			2020, a new "Party Royale" mode was added, taking place on a small map where combat and construction was disabled though non-lethal
			gameplay items can be acquired like paint guns and vehicles; this map was aimed to be used as a social space, as well as to host
			in-game events like concerts.<sup>[10]</sup>

		</p>

		<p>

			Prior to September 2019, <b><i>Fortnite</i></b> did not have specialized matchmaking, outside of platform and regional limits.
			With an upcoming patch, the game will introduced skill-based matchmaking, based on internal metrics that judge a player's skill
			in the game. Further, with Chapter 2 Season 1, the game will add special matches against computer-controlled bots to help players
			practice the game.<sup>[11]</sup>
